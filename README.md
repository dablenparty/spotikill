## Why?

Lets face it: the Spotify desktop app has a lot of problems. Sometimes, the only way to fix it is to totally kill it and restart it. This is a pain, especially if you're in the middle of something. This program aims to make that process easier. It runs in the tray and when you right click it, it gives you the option to kill Spotify. It can't restart it for you (thanks, Windows), but it saves you from having to open Task Manager and find the process.

## Usage

Just run the executable. It will run in the tray and stay out of your way. Right click it to kill Spotify. I recommend setting it to run on startup which can be done very easily with the following instructions:

1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog
2. Type `shell:startup` and press Enter
3. Move the executable (or a shortcut) into the folder that opens
4. Done!
